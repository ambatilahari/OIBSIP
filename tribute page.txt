				Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman FRS ( 7 November 1888 – 21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist known for his work in the field of light scattering.
                        Using a spectrograph that he developed, he and his student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light changes its wavelength and frequency.
                        This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, which they called "modified scattering" was subsequently termed the Raman effect or Raman scattering. 
                        Raman received the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.

<p>
				☛ C.V. Raman, in full Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman, (born November 7, 1888, Trichinopoly, India—died November 21, 1970, Bangalore)<br><br>
				☛ He was the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930 for the discovery that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the light that is deflected changes in wavelength.<br><br>
				☛ This phenomenon is now called Raman scattering and is the result of the Raman effect.<br><br>
				☛ After earning a master’s degree in physics at Presidency College, University of Madras, in 1907, Raman became an accountant in the finance department of the Indian government.<br><br> 
			        ☛ He became professor of physics at the University of Calcutta in 1917. <br><br> 
                                ☛ Raman frequencies are the energies associated with transitions between different rotational and vibrational states in the scattering material.

				<br><br> 
                                ☛Raman was knighted in 1929, and in 1933 he moved to the Indian Institute of Science, at Bangalore, as head of the department of physics. 
				<br><br> 
                                ☛ In 1947 he was named director of the Raman Research Institute there and in 1961 became a member of the Pontifical Academy of Science.
				<br><br>
                                ☛  He contributed to the building up of nearly every Indian research institution in his time, founded the Indian Journal of Physics and the Indian Academy of Sciences, 
                                   and trained hundreds of students who found important posts in universities and government in India and Myanmar (Burma).
				<br><br> 
                                ☛ He was the uncle of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who won the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics, with William Fowler. 
                        <br><br> 
                                ☛ He has two sons, Radhakrishnan and Chandrashekhar. His son Radhakrishnan went on to become a well-known astronomer.
				<br><br>
                                ☛ He was also given India's highest accolade, the Bharat Ratna, in 1954 for his tremendous contribution to science.
				<br><br> 
                                ☛ In 1948, he retired from the Indian Institute of Science (IIS).
				<br><br> 
                               ☛ CV Raman, the brilliant scientist, spent much of his time in the laboratory, making new findings and seeking information.
				<br><br> 
                               ☛C.V. Raman, the scientist who brought India widespread prominence in science, may no longer be with us,
                                but his essential discoveries will always be with us; his extraordinary findings are still utilized on a big scale nowadays.
